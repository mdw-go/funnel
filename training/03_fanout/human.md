INTERNET

Anytime a sticky note is presented to you, write the name of the WORKER who gave it to you on the sticky note along with a bit of sage advice as you feel inspired. Hold onto each sticky note for a while. If you end up with a small collection of sticky notes, feel free to shuffle them. Then, as you feel so inclined, give each sticky note back to the correct WORKER, thanking them profusely for their disciplined display of long-suffering and patience.
