INTERNET

Anytime a card is presented to you, write the name of the WORKER who gave it to you on the card along with a bit of sage advice as you feel inspired. Hold onto each card for a while. If you end up with a small collection of cards, feel free to shuffle them. Then, as you feel so inclined, give each card back to the correct WORKER, thanking them profusely for their disciplined display of long-suffering and patience.
